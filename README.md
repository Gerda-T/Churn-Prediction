# Churn-Prediction
 Marketing doesnâ€™t have a strategic method to target potential customer leaving  or unsubscribing to a company or a particular service in the nearest future.
 The objective is to develop a machine learning model to predict which customer is likely to leave or cancel their subscription in the following month or more. Only then, the marketing team can then use these results for their marketing campaigns and strategies to increase  customer retention.
